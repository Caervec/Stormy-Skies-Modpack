# Stormy-Skies-Repository
 Stormy Skies modpack local workspace.

Stormy Skies is something of a hobby project being created by a single amateur modpack maker: me, Caervec. Because of this, the process for updating will be very slow.

This modpack projects a vision of a challenging, slow-paced skyblock map founded on the idea of building a comfortable little world for yourself out of limited supplies that become more abundant as you progress the game. Progress will be slow. It may be painful sometimes, in fact. Resources will require you to manage them carefully and to puzzle out what supplies you can get from where. Each accessible dimension is likewise limited in size and scope, each offering unique materials to help you on your way. 
Ultimately, you make the world in which you want to live, with a final gift of MystCraft to let you sculpt a truly infinite world of your own desire in the end, should you so choose.
